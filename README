Bjoern is a two-step simulation of particle trajectories in all-electrostatic
electron-optical devices, e.g. electron sources or energy analysers used in
surface science.

In the first step, the electrostatic potential is calculated, based on a
solution of the Poisson equation with known boundary conditions: the potential
of electrodes, which are used as an input parameter, which is read from the
file.

The second step is the calculation of actual particle trajectories in the
so-calculated electrostatic potential, neglecting space charge effects for the
sake of simplicity. The trajectories have initial conditions that are randomly
chosen from distributions of the starting coordinates and velocities.
